# 👾 Welcome to My Personal Corner!

Hey there! I'm **Joni**, a Full Stack Developer who loves building things that feel smooth, work reliably, and have personality.

## 💻🎮⚽☕ About Me

**Full Stack Developer**  
I enjoy crafting projects from the ground up — from clean UI to the backend logic that keeps everything running flawlessly.

**Gamer at Heart**  
I love getting lost in virtual worlds, exploring new game mechanics, and discovering clever designs that inspire my own work.

**Sports Enthusiast**  
Training keeps me grounded. Whether it’s running, boxing, or going to the gym, sports are my daily reset button.

**Coffee Fueled**  
Coffee isn’t just a drink — it’s my buff.  
Give me a strong cup and I’m ready to tackle any bug, feature, or boss fight.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This space is where I share my builds, experiments, and creative ideas — from web apps to small games and everything in between.  
Each project carries a bit of my curiosity, a chunk of my time, and a lot of code.

If something here inspires you, helps you, or simply makes you smile… mission accomplished.

## 🎮✨ Lately: Mixing Gaming + Coding

Recently, I've been diving into **game development**, exploring engines, prototypes, and design ideas.  
Game dev lets me merge two of my biggest passions: **playing games** and **building things**.

Creating worlds, mechanics, and systems scratches a creative itch I didn’t know I had — and I’m loving it.
